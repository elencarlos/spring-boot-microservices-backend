# Critique

Because the test doesn't ask for authentication(that will be provided after), the user that create a post, repost or quote, need to be sendend in the post's boddy or query param, if not it is getted ramdomly in the user microsevice. 
To improve this, I would build an oauth2 microservice that will be used to authenticate the user, or chage the gateway to work as OAuth 2.0 Resource Server.

For the purpose of this test I used Eureka to register the microservices and Spring Cloud Gateway. But they can be replaced by kubernetes discovery and Ingress as gateway.
